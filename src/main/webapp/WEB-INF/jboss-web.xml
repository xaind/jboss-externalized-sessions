        <!-- Clustering only: Determines when the container should consider that a session must be replicated across the cluster. Possible values are:
            1 - "ACCESS"
            2 - "SET_AND_GET"
            3 - "SET_AND_NON_PRIMITIVE_GET" (default value)
            4 - "SET"

            The rationale for this setting is that after a mutable object stored as a session attribute is accessed from the session, in the absence of a setAttribute
            call the container has no clear way to know if the object (and hence the session state) has been modified. In all cases, calling setAttribute marks the session
            as needing replication. ACCESS - merely accessing the session marks the session as dirty. SET_AND_GET is conservative but not optimal (performance-wise): it
            will always replicate the session even if its content has not been modified but simply accessed. SET_AND_NON_PRIMITIVE_GET is conservative but will only replicate
            if a non-primitive Object has been accessed (i.e. the object is not of a well-known immutable JDK type such as Integer, Long, String, etc.) This is the default
            value. SET assumes that the developer will explicitly call setAttribute on the session if it needs to be replicated. This setting prevents unnecessary replication,
            but requires very good coding practices to ensure setAttribute is always called whenever an attribute value is modified.

           Examples: <replication-trigger>SET_AND_GET</replication-trigger>
                  or <replication-trigger>SET_AND_NON_PRIMITIVE_GET</replication-trigger>
                  or <replication-trigger>SET</replication-trigger>

        <!-- Clustering only: Determines the session replication mode. Possible values are: 1 - "SYNCHRONOUS" 2 - "ASYNCHRONOUS" In SYNCHRONOUS mode, session replication
             occurs in the same thread that processes a given request. A request will not complete until the associated session is successfully replicated. In ASYNCHRONOUS
             mode, session replication occurs in a separate thread from the one that processes a given request. The request thread only initiates replication, but does not
             wait for it to complete. If not defined, the replication mode defined in the distributed cache configuration will be used. In the default distributed session
             cache configuration, sessions replicate asynchronously.

             Examples: <replication-mode>SYNCHRONOUS</replication-mode>
                    or <replication-mode>ASYNCHRONOUS</replication-mode>

             session count below max-active-sessions. A value of -1 (the default) disables passivating sessions before passivation-max-idle-time. Neither a value of -1 nor a
             high value are recommended if max-active-sessions is set.

             Example: <passivation-min-idle-time>30</passivation-min-idle-time> (seconds)

        <!-- Determines the maximum time (in seconds) that a session can be inactive before the container should attempt to passivate it to save memory. Passivation of such
             sessions will take place regardless of whether the active session count exceeds max-active-sessions. Should be less than the web.xml session-timeout setting. A
             value of -1 disables passivation based on maximum inactivity.
